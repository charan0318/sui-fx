We use automated tools to maintain consistent code style:

```bash
# Linting
npm run lint          # Check for issues
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix issues

# Formatting
npm run format        # Format with Prettier

# Type checking
npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation
```

**Key Standards:**
- **TypeScript** for all new code
- **ESLint + Prettier** for consistent formatting
- **Conventional Commits** for commit messages
- **Camel case** for variables and functions
- **Pascal case** for classes and components

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

npm run test:coverage
```

**Testing Guidelines:**
- **Unit tests** for business logic
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints
- **E2E tests** for critical user flows
- **Minimum 80% coverage** for new features
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions

### üìù Commit Message Format
